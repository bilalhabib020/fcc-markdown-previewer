# Markdown Previewer

## Description

The **Markdown Previewer** is a React-based application that enables users to write and preview Markdown text in real-time. This app is especially helpful for developers, writers, and Markdown enthusiasts who want to create or edit Markdown content with instant feedback on how it will render.

## Features

- **Markdown Editor:** A text area for writing Markdown with real-time updates.
- **Live Preview:** Renders the Markdown as HTML and displays it side-by-side.
- **Expandable Sections:** Expand or minimize the editor and previewer for focused or side-by-side editing.
- **Default Markdown Template:** Comes with an initial sample of Markdown syntax to explore its features.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Bootstrap for a clean and adaptable layout.

## Technologies Used

- **React** for building the user interface.
- **Bootstrap** for responsive styling.
- **Marked.js** for converting Markdown to HTML.
- **FontAwesome** for icons used in the expand/minimize buttons.

## How It Works

1. **Edit Markdown:** Users can type Markdown text in the editor, and it updates the previewer in real time.
2. **Expand/Minimize Sections:** Use the expand/minimize button on either the editor or previewer for enhanced focus.
3. **Preview Rendered Markdown:** The previewer displays a live HTML representation of the Markdown text.
